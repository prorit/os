# Banker's Algorithm Implementation (C)

This C program implements the Banker's Algorithm, a deadlock avoidance algorithm. It checks if a system state (defined by processes, resources, allocation, maximum needs, and available resources) is safe and finds a safe sequence if one exists.

## Code

**Filename:** `banker.c` (You can use any name ending in `.c`)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_PROCESSES 5
#define MAX_RESOURCES 3

void calculateSafeSequence(int processes, int resources, int allocation[][MAX_RESOURCES], int maximum[][MAX_RESOURCES], int available[], int safeSequence[]) {
    int need[MAX_PROCESSES][MAX_RESOURCES];
    int finish[MAX_PROCESSES] = {0}; 
    int work[MAX_RESOURCES];
    int count = 0;
    int i, j;

    for (i = 0; i < processes; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < resources; j++) {
            need[i][j] = maximum[i][j] - allocation[i][j];
        }
    }

    for (i = 0; i < resources; i++) {
        work[i] = available[i];
    }

    while (count < processes) {
        int found = 0;
        for (i = 0; i < processes; i++) {
            if (!finish[i]) {
                int canProceed = 1;
                for (j = 0; j < resources; j++) {
                    if (need[i][j] > work[j]) {

                }
                if (canProceed) {
                    for (j = 0; j < resources; j++) {
                        work[j] += allocation[i][j];
                    }
                    safeSequence[count++] = i;
                    finish[i] = 1;
                    found = 1;

            printf("The system is in an unsafe state.\n");
            return;
        }
    }

    printf("The system is in a safe state.\nSafe sequence: ");
    for (i = 0; i < processes; i++) {
        printf("P%d", safeSequence[i]);
        if (i != processes - 1) {
            printf(" -> ");
        }
    }
    printf("\n");

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the C code above into a file named `banker.c`.

2.  **Compile the Code:** Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved `banker.c`, and use the GNU C Compiler (`gcc`) to compile it. This will create an executable file named `banker`.

    ```bash
    gcc banker.c -o banker
    ```

3.  **Run the Program:** Execute the compiled program from the terminal using the `./` prefix.

    ```bash
    ./banker
    ```

The program will print whether the system is in a safe state based on the hardcoded values and provide a safe sequence if one is found.
