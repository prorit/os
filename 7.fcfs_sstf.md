# FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) Disk Scheduling (C)

This C program simulates the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) disk scheduling algorithm. This is the simplest algorithm, where disk requests are serviced in the order they arrive in the queue.

The program takes the following inputs from the user:
1.  The total number of disk requests.
2.  The sequence of disk cylinder requests.
3.  The initial position of the disk head.

It calculates and prints the sequence in which the requests are serviced, the total seek time (total head movement), and the average seek time.

## Code

**Filename:** `fcfs.c` (You can use any name ending in `.c`)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void fcfsDiskScheduling(int requests[], int n, int head) {
    int totalSeekTime = 0, i;

    printf("\nSequence of disk accesses:\n");
    printf("%d", head);

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int seekDistance = abs(requests[i] - head);
        totalSeekTime += seekDistance;
        head = requests[i];
        printf(" -> %d", head);
    }

    printf("\n\nTotal Seek Time: %d\n", totalSeekTime);
    printf("Average Seek Time: %.2f\n", (float)totalSeekTime / n);
}

int main() {
    int n, head, i;
    int *requests;

    printf("Enter the number of disk requests: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    if (n <= 0) {
        printf("Error: Invalid number of requests.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    requests = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int)); 

    if (requests == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Enter the disk request queue: ");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &requests[i]);
    }

    printf("Enter the initial head position: ");
    scanf("%d", &head);

    fcfsDiskScheduling(requests, n, head);

    free(requests);

    return 0;
}
```

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the C code above into a file named `fcfs.c`.
2.  **Compile the Code:** Open your terminal, navigate to the file's directory, and compile using GCC:
    ```bash
    gcc fcfs.c -o fcfs
    ```
3.  **Run the Program:** Execute the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./fcfs
    ```
    The program will then prompt you to enter the number of requests, the request queue (space-separated numbers), and the initial head position.

# SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First) Disk Scheduling (C)

This C program simulates the Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) disk scheduling algorithm. SSTF selects the request with the least seek time from the current head position, prioritizing speed over fairness.

The program takes the following inputs from the user:
1.  The total number of disk requests.
2.  The sequence of disk cylinder requests.
3.  The initial position of the disk head.

It calculates and prints the sequence in which the requests are serviced, the total seek time (total head movement), and the average seek time.

**Filename:** `sstf.c` (You can use any name ending in `.c`)
