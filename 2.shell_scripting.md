This document contains shell scripts extracted from terminal screenshots.

## How to Run These Scripts

1.  **Save the Code:** Copy the code block for a script and save it to a file with the suggested filename (e.g., `arithmetic.sh`).
2.  **Make Executable:** Open your terminal, navigate to the file's directory, and run:
    ```bash
    chmod +x filename.sh
    ```
    (Replace `filename.sh` with the actual name).
3.  **Run the Script:** Execute the script from the terminal:
    ```bash
    ./filename.sh
    ```
    (Replace `filename.sh` with the actual name).
