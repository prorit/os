# Child Process Creation (using fork())

This is a simple C program that demonstrates the creation of a new process (a child process) from an existing process (the parent process) using the `fork()` system call in Unix-like operating systems.

After calling `fork()`, the program splits into two identical processes (except for their PIDs and the return value of `fork()`). Each process then checks the return value of `fork()` to determine if it is the parent or the child and prints relevant process information (PID and Parent PID).

## Code

**Filename:** `fork.c` (or any other name ending in `.c`)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main(){
    pid_t pid;

    pid = fork();

    if(pid < 0){
        perror("Fork failed");
        return 1;
    }
    else if(pid == 0){
        printf("Child Process:\n");
        printf("PID: %d\n", getpid());
        printf("PPID: %d\n", getppid());
    }
    else{
        printf("Parent Process\n");
        printf("PID %d\n", getpid());
        printf("Child PID %d\n", pid);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the C code above into a file named `fork.c` (or your preferred `.c` filename).

2.  **Compile the Code:** Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved `fork.c`, and use the GNU C Compiler (`gcc`) to compile it. We'll create an executable file named `fork`.

    ```bash
    gcc fork.c -o fork
    ```

3.  **Run the Program:** Execute the compiled program from the terminal using the `./` prefix.

    ```bash
    ./fork
    ```
