Here is a list of the distinct commands seen in the provided terminal output and how they are typically used:

*   **`cat`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Displays the content of a file(s).
    *   **Example:** `cat /etc/passwd` (displays the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file).

*   **`cd`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Changes the current working directory.
    *   **Example:** `cd A-11` (moves into the subdirectory named `A-11`). `cd ..` (moves one directory up).
    *   *(Note: `sudo cd` in the image resulted in an error because `cd` is a shell built-in, not an executable command that `sudo` runs directly in the same way).*

*   **`cp`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Copies files or directories from one location to another.
    *   **Example:** `cp source_file destination_file` (copies `source_file` to `destination_file`).

*   **`groupadd`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Creates a new user group.
    *   **Example:** `sudo groupadd newgroup` (creates a group named `newgroup` - requires root privileges).

*   **`groupdel`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Deletes a user group.
    *   **Example:** `sudo groupdel oldgroup` (deletes the group named `oldgroup` - requires root privileges).

*   **`groups`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Prints the names of the groups a user is a member of. If no username is specified, it shows groups for the current user.
    *   **Example:** `groups Satya` (shows the groups that user `Satya` belongs to).

*   **`ls`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Lists the contents of a directory.
    *   **Example:** `ls` (lists files and directories in the current directory). `ls -l` (lists in long format with details).

*   **`mkdir`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Creates new directories (folders).
    *   **Example:** `mkdir new_directory` (creates a directory named `new_directory`). `mkdir -p path/to/new_directory` (creates parent directories if they don't exist).

*   **`mv`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Moves or renames files and directories.
    *   **Example:** `mv old_name new_name` (renames `old_name` to `new_name`). `mv file /path/to/destination` (moves `file` to the destination directory).

*   **`nano`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Opens a simple command-line text editor to create or edit files.
    *   **Example:** `nano filename` (opens `filename` in the nano editor).

*   **`passwd`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Changes the password for a user account. If run without a username by a regular user, it changes their own password. If run by root or with `sudo`, it can change any user's password.
    *   **Example:** `passwd` (change password for the current user). `sudo passwd username` (change password for `username` - requires root privileges).

*   **`pwd`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Prints the current working directory (shows you where you are in the file system).
    *   **Example:** `pwd`.

*   **`su`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Switches the current user context to another user. Often used to switch to the `root` user (`su -`) or another specific user (`su username`). Requires the target user's password.
    *   **Example:** `su Satya` (attempts to switch to the `Satya` user).

*   **`sudo`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Executes a command as another user, typically the root user. It checks the `/etc/sudoers` file to see if the current user is permitted to run the specified command. Usually requires the *current* user's password.
    *   **Example:** `sudo useradd newuser` (runs the `useradd` command with root privileges).

*   **`touch`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Creates a new empty file if it doesn't exist, or updates the access and modification timestamps of an existing file.
    *   **Example:** `touch new_file.txt` (creates an empty file named `new_file.txt`).

*   **`useradd`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Creates a new user account.
    *   **Example:** `sudo useradd newuser` (creates a user named `newuser` - requires root privileges).

*   **`userdel`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Deletes a user account.
    *   **Example:** `sudo userdel username` (deletes the user `username` - requires root privileges).

*   **`usermod`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Modifies an existing user account. Can be used to change home directory, shell, group memberships, etc.
    *   **Example:** `sudo usermod -aG groupname username` (adds `username` to `groupname`). The `-a` is crucial to *append* to existing groups, not replace them.

*   **`whoami`**:
    *   **How to use it:** Prints the effective username of the current user.
    *   **Example:** `whoami` (shows your username). `sudo whoami` (shows the user you are running the command *as*, usually `root` when used with `sudo`).
