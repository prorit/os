# Custom `mv` Program (using kernel syscalls)

This is a simple C program that attempts to mimic the functionality of the `mv` command (move or rename) using low-level system calls (`rename` and `link`/`unlink`).

It first tries to use the `rename()` system call. If that fails (e.g., moving across file systems), it attempts to use `link()` to create a hard link at the destination and then `unlink()` to delete the source file.

## Code

**Filename:** `mymv.c` (You can name it anything, but `mymv.c` is descriptive)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    if(argc != 3){
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <source> <destination>\n", argv[0]);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Attempt to move/rename using the rename() syscall
    if(rename(argv[1], argv[2]) == 0){
        printf("Moved successfully!\n");
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

    // If rename failed, try to simulate move using link() followed by unlink()
    if(link(argv[1], argv[2]) == 0){
        unlink(argv[1]); // Remove the source file after successful linking
        printf("Moved successfully using link + unlink!\n");
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

    // If both methods failed
    perror("Error moving file");
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
```

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the C code above into a file named `mymv.c` (or any other name ending in `.c`).

2.  **Compile the Code:** Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and use the GNU C Compiler (`gcc`) to compile it. We'll create an executable file named `mv` (lowercase, without the `.c` extension).

    ```bash
    gcc mymv.c -o mv
    ```

3.  **Run the Program:** You can now execute the compiled program `./mv`. It requires two arguments: the source file and the destination path/name.

    ```bash
    ./mv <source_file> <destination_path_or_name>
    ```
